Before using Docker, several problems can arise when deploying and running applications across different environments. Here are the key challenges:

1. "It Works on My Machine" Problem
ðŸ’¡ Issue: The app runs fine on your local machine but fails on another system due to different dependencies, OS versions, or configurations.
ðŸ”§ Docker Solution: Packages everything (code, dependencies, environment) into a container, ensuring consistency across all machines.

2. Dependency Hell
ðŸ’¡ Issue: Conflicting versions of libraries, frameworks, or packages can break the app when installed on a new system.
ðŸ”§ Docker Solution: Containers have isolated environments, so your app runs with the exact versions it needs.

3. Deployment Inconsistencies
ðŸ’¡ Issue: The app works in development but crashes in production due to different configurations.
ðŸ”§ Docker Solution: Docker ensures the same setup is used in both development and production.

4. Port Conflicts & Environment Variables
ðŸ’¡ Issue: Manually setting up ports, environment variables, and dependencies is error-prone and inconsistent.
ðŸ”§ Docker Solution: Uses Docker Compose to define everything in a docker-compose.yml file for easy management.

5. Scaling is Hard
ðŸ’¡ Issue: Running multiple instances of your app on different machines is complex.
ðŸ”§ Docker Solution: Works with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm to scale easily.
